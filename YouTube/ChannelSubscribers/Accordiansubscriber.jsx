      <div className="collapse-content text-sm">There are several reasons, it keeps you from violating YouTube's official <br/> policies and terms of use.

      <div className="collapse-title text-lg md:text-lg sm:text-sm font-bold">Is it possible to buy 1000 Youtube subscribers to fullfill monetization requirements?</div>
      <div className="collapse-content text-sm">Yes, you can complete 1000 subscribers in two ways. First, if the channel<br/> is new, buy the smallest package, and then the one with a few hundred <br/>subscribers. This way, the activity will remain clean and not be  <br/>considered spammy. Another option is to buy 1000 subscribers if the <br/> channel already has a considerable number of subscribers. But these <br/>are all initial steps, to complete the monetization process on YouTube, <br/>you still have to fulfill certain requirements. </div>
